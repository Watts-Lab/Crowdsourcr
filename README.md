Crowdsourcr is a tool to create surveys programmatically and run them in a browser. Amazon Turk integration is inbuilt.

- Surveys are defined in XML format.
- A survey consists of modules and modules consist of questions.
- A task is some content (such as an image or a piece of text) paired with a sequence of modules/questions.
- A Crowdsourcr HIT (or cHIT) consists of a set of tasks 
- Two cHITs can contain the same tasks. This allows for programmatic definition of double or triple data entry.
- If a task is completed by more than one worker a bonus can be paid depending on agreement and if the question is defined as a bonus question in the XML.
