Welcome to Crowdsourcr!
=======================================

Crowdsourcer is an application for conducting survey-like experiments
online, especially when used in conjunction with Amazon Mechanical
Turk.  It is designed to show some number of questions next to some
document, such as a news article.

The following is an example from one real experiment:
